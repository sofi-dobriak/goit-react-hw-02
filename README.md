## Homework â„–2

In this project, we practiced using the useState and useEffect hooks, as well as state management in React. The main functionality includes:

-   Rating a cafe: the user can choose one of three ratings:
    -   Good
    -   Neutral
    -   Bad
-   Automatic calculation of the percentage of positive feedback based on the selected ratings.
-   The ability to reset all ratings to their initial values.
-   The Reset button becomes available only after the user has left at least one rating.
